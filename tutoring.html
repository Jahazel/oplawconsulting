        <h1>LSAT Tutoring with Relatability and Experience</h1>
        <h3>Personalized daily study plans, made just for you.</h3>
        <p>
          What sets me apart as an LSAT tutor is my balance of relatability and
          experience. I took the LSAT in 2024, so I understand exactly what
          today’s prep feels like — the pressure, the plateaus, and the grind.
          I’ve logged over 350 hours of tutoring and worked with students at
          every score range, from climbing out of the 140s to breaking into the
          170s. I started with a diagnostic score of 149 myself, so I know what
          it’s like to feel stuck — and more importantly, how to move forward.
          Every student gets a <b>custom daily study plan</b> tailored to your
          schedule, goals, and learning style. Whether you’re aiming for your
          first big jump or fine-tuning for the finish line, I’m here to help
          you get there with strategies that work and support that gets it.

        <h3>Free Consultation</h3>
        <p>
          A free 30-minute consultation with me is available for any prospective
          student. This meeting allows the prospective student to determine if I
          am the right fit for them.
        </p>

        <h3>Standard Rates</h3>
        <p>
          Let’s talk pricing: lessons are <strong>$130/hour</strong>. And I get
          it—your first thought might be, <em>“Whoa, that’s a lot.”</em> But
          here’s the thing: I’m actually on the more affordable end of quality
          LSAT tutoring. When I tutored through 7Sage, students were regularly
          paying up to <strong>$200/hour</strong> for the exact same help I’m
          offering now—just without the platform taking a cut. You’re getting
          top-tier support, customized to <em>you</em>, from someone who’s been
          in your shoes and knows how to get results.
        </p>

        <h3>Payment Options</h3>
        <p>
          Payment is due before each session and can be made via Venmo or
          Zelle—whatever’s easiest for you.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Venmo:</strong> @Pat0h
            <em
              >(that’s a zero, not an “O” — the profile photo is me giving a
              thumbs up!)</em
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Zelle:</strong> Linked to my phone number: (310) 753-5769
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
        <p>
          If you ever need to cancel a session, just let me know at least
          <strong>12 hours in advance</strong>—no problem at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a session is missed without notice, the policy is to charge
          <strong>half the session rate</strong>. That said, I know life
          happens, so I’ll always do my best to be understanding in case of
          emergencies or extenuating circumstances. I just like to be upfront
          about this ahead of time so there are no surprises later on.
