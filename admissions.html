        <h1>Real Results. Personal Guidance. Limited Spots.</h1>
        <p>
          I applied to law school during the ultra-competitive 2024–25 cycle—and
          came out the other side with offers from
          <b>Harvard, Stanford, Penn, NYU, Duke, Cornell</b>, and several other
          top law schools. I navigated this process as a
          <b>KJD (straight from undergrad)</b> and know firsthand how
          overwhelming, expensive, and high-stakes it can be.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why I offer personalized admissions consulting—designed to give
          you the tools, guidance, and honest feedback you need to craft your
          strongest possible application without wasting time or money. In fact,
          I saved over <b>$2,000</b> throughout my own process, and I’ll help
          you do the same—through smart school selection, strategic application
          timing, and fee waiver maximization.
